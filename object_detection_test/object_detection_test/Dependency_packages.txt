-----How to build the file -------
\\run this in the terminal because your object detection code is n this folder so you need to build your model in this repo//
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash

---adds to the bashrc file
echo "source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
